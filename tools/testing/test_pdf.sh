# Create a simple test PDF (placeholder - in real scenario you'd have actual PDFs)
echo "For PDF testing, you can use any PDF file. Common test cases:"
echo ""
echo "1. **Text-based PDF**: Document with selectable text"
echo "   - Example: Reports, articles, books with text"
echo "   - Expected: PDF analysis with text extraction indicators"
echo ""
echo "2. **Image-based PDF**: Scanned document or image converted to PDF"
echo "   - Example: Scanned forms, old documents, screenshots"
echo "   - Expected: PDF analysis indicating OCR may be needed"
echo ""
echo "3. **Mixed content PDF**: Combination of text and images"
echo "   - Example: Presentation slides, technical documents"
echo "   - Expected: PDF analysis showing both types of content"

# Test with send_file utility

echo ""
echo "# Send a local PDF file"
echo "./send_file -a @your_atsign -g @agent_atsign -f /path/to/document.pdf -n ogents"
echo ""
echo "# Send a PDF from URL"
echo "./send_file -a @your_atsign -g @agent_atsign -u https://example.com/document.pdf -n ogents"

echo "üîç Expected PDF analysis output:"
echo "- PDF version and metadata"
echo "- Content type identification (text-based vs image-based)"
echo "- Processing recommendations"
echo "- File structure analysis"
echo "- Security status (encrypted/unencrypted)"
echo ""

echo "üöÄ To enable full PDF text extraction and OCR:"
echo "1. Integrate PDF text extraction library"
echo "2. Add OCR service integration (Google Vision, AWS Textract, etc.)"
echo "3. Enhance PDF parsing for complex layouts"
echo ""

echo "‚úÖ PDF processing framework is ready for enhancement!"
