# The issue is that pdf_ocr package was built with an older version of flutter_rust_bridge
# We need to either:
# 1. Rebuild the package with the current FRB version, or
# 2. Use a different PDF processing library

echo "ðŸ’¡ Recommended solutions:"
echo "1. Use a pure Dart PDF library (simpler, no native dependencies)"
echo "2. Use a different OCR package that's actively maintained"
echo "3. Build pdf_ocr from source with current flutter_rust_bridge"
